# CS141-Code
All my code from the class CS141

So, basically I factory reset my computer half way through a computer science class and lost a lot of code. This repository is designed to ensure that never happens again. 
As far as using this code is concerned, use it as you see fit, up to and excluding plagurism. I should probobly put this under a licence of some sort, but basically if you have questions on a program, you can refer to this for an answer, but you CANNOT use this just because your feeling lazy. There is no promise about having any needed program for referance, or even having correct programs. Most of this should compile on linux in spring 2018, and not much is expected to change anytime soon, but on windows these will be hard to compile, since the string library tends to not want to work on that platform for me. No testing has been performed on mac os, and the only linux platform tested was ubuntu. 

To compile a program on a compatible platform, run the command g++ <filetocompile> -o testfile
Ex. g++ payrollCalc.cpp -o payrollCalc
All programs in the main directory are stand alone programs, although they may have associated files, those files are not required for compilation.
